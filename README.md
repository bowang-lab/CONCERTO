### Abstract:

`
Molecular carcinogenicity is a preventable cause of cancer, however, most experimentaltesting of molecular compounds is an expensive and time consuming process, making highthroughput experimental approaches infeasible. In recent years, there has been substantialprogress in adopting machine learning as an appealing alternative forin vivoprediction ofmolecule carcinogenicity. In this work, we propose a new system, CONCERTO, which usesa graph transformer in conjunction with a molecular fingerprint representation, trained onmulti-round mutagenicity and carcinogenicity objectives. To train and validate CONCERTO,we augment the training dataset with more informative labels and utilize a larger externalvalidation dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model yields results superiorto alternate approaches for molecular carcinogenicity prediction.
